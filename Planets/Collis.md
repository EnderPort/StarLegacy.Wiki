## Quick Notes

Low hills, little trees. This place is a great place to make a home for yourself. Luxivitas is the ruling force here and control the planet, holding almost the entire north-eastern corner. Settlers are welcome on Collis, but be warned that Luxivitas will quickly put down hostile settlements present on the planet. Collis is known as the Australian Planet due to it's continental structure and climate. The only dangers here are the lava rivers spewing from Gloricus Volcano and the spiders. Lots of spiders. Farming is the main use due to it's nice growth rate. In addition to the large main island, 3 other isles exist. An isle to the west, Avalon Island, where the NPC trade area (Collost) is based. On the same island are also claimable territories. To the far east and south are also small islands with bases. 

Coal is found throughout the island but not in large quantities. Collis is useless for mining. So long as you don't provoke Luxivitas or cause trouble, you will be relatively safe on Collis.

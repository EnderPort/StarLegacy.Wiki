# Settlements

You can claim unclaimed regions as settlements. To create one, use the command, in game; /s create <settlement name>

When you do this, it will tell you the price and ask you to confirm.

To keep a claim at least 1 member must have logged in within 30 days. If no members of the settlement have logged in after 30 days have passed the settlement is automatically purged and deleted. The land is unclaimed (for the only exception read below under nation claimed settlements) and anyone can pillage and grief and steal from it.

## Activity Credits

Every day for every active member who has logged in the past 3 days the nations bank will increase by 10 credits. For example: 3 members are in a nation and all log in every day, the nation would get 300 credits per day. 2 members log in but one does not they will receive 30 credits per day for only 3 days, after that if the person who hasn't logged in doesn't log in the nation will increase by only 20 credits per day if the other two members are active.

## Settlement Commands
